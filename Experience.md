So far, this little module has explained GitHub quite well. 
I guess, of any questions I have, does the name of an account affect how it is viewed professionally by those conducting interviews for a job? I used this account for the class because I had created it a while back to contact someone who created a mod 
for a game I've enjoyed a lot, and used my common online alias for it. I have a separate email that I plan to use for professional uses, and I'm wondering if that is what I should do for GitHub as well.
